Question 1 - "Heaviest Hitters"
Querying for the team with the highest average weight on each year
My solution (Not Finish):

WITH 
	temp
 AS(
  SELECT 
		batting.yearid AS year,
		ROUND(AVG(people.weight),0) AS team_avg_weight,
  	teams.name AS team_name
	FROM
		people
	JOIN batting ON people.playerid = batting.playerid
	JOIN teams ON batting.teamid = teams.teamid
	GROUP BY 1,3
	ORDER BY 1
   )
SELECT temp.year, MAX(temp.team_avg_weight)
FROM temp
GROUP BY year
